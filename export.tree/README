## Dataset Overview
This dataset contains functional and structural MRI data collected to investigate neural activity
elicited by the dim7 chord in listeners with refined music listening skills. Data were acquired at Imaging Center for Integrated Body, Mind, and Culture Research at National Taiwan University using a 3T MR system (MAGNETOM Prisma, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).

## Data Structure
The dataset follows the BIDS standard and includes the following:
- Anatomical T1-weighted MRI scans.
- Functional MRI scans.
- Event files describing the task conditions for functional MRI.
